# Overview

This software was a collection of tutorials and tests to determine how our team will want to continue on our project. I explored some aspects of Javascript and working with the DOM and began learning REACT. 

This app has two parts, one is the webpage that displays information about elements. The other part of this software is the REACT webpage that has a button that I created as a test and to do list tutorial I completed. 

To use the REACT page you must run a terminal on the index.js page and type in "npm start".

The purpose of this software is to determine the next steps on my team's software and help learn the skills needed.



{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Web Pages

There are two main webpages in my software. The first is chemistry.html page which populates the list of elements. The second is the REACT program which you run using the index.js. These do not transition between each other.

On the chemistry page there are modules populated dynamically by the press of a button. On the REACT page the to do list creates checkboxes that dynamically can be selected and deselected.


# Development Environment
I used Visual Studio Code in the development of this software.

The programming languages used include Javascript, HTM, and CSS. The Javascript library REACT was also utlized in this project.
